# Airbnb-London-Price-Prediction
This repository is a collection of files and programs detailing the price prediction of the London Airbnb price prediction technical challenge

In the first file named "AirbnbPrice_Prediction_using_XGBOOST" we have used machine learning methods i.e Linear Regression and XGBoost to identify a suitable price point or range for a new lister of property to the Airbnb site or a similar property listing site in the London area.

In the second file named "Airbnb_review using NLP" we have made use of Natural Language Processing Libraries such as NLTK and its associated corpus in order to identify highly important keywords that have been extracted from all the reviews present in the Dataset, so that the new lister can append these keywords into his property description in order to drive more traffic via Search Engine Optimization (SEO) towards his property and its is also a valuable tool for existing listers to see what are the curent search terms people in the London Boroughs are looking for.
